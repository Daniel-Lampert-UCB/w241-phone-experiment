## Plot histograms of cleaned data

```{r}

```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(`screen_time_avg_final`, fill = factor(treatment))) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.2, position = 'dodge') + labs(title="Final Screen Time Averages")
```


```{r}
# replace na values in baseline (screen_time_avg_initial) with average of that column
# this is okay because we want an average baseline of where people are
# we don't want to do this with screen_time_avg_final because of attrition (we want to know which people didn't come back)
# we do this separately for treatment and control group
data$screen_time_avg_initial[is.na(data$screen_time_avg_initial) & data$treatment == 1] <- mean(treatment$screen_time_avg_initial,na.rm=TRUE)

data$screen_time_avg_initial[is.na(data$screen_time_avg_initial) & data$treatment == 0] <- mean(control$screen_time_avg_initial,na.rm=TRUE)

# getting the difference between final and initial screen times
data[, diff := screen_time_avg_final - screen_time_avg_initial]
```


```{r}
# compare individuals' initial and final averages
ggplot(data, aes(`diff`, fill = factor(treatment))) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.2, position = 'dodge') + labs(title="Screen Time Average Difference")
```


## Estimating ATE, ITT, and CACE ignoring attrition

```{r}
# making greyscale (receiving treatment) and iphone variables binary for analysis

data[, greyscale_binary := ifelse(greyscale =='Yes', 1, 0)]
data[is.na(greyscale_binary), greyscale_binary:=0]
# makes iphone column binary (iphone = 1, android = 0)
data$iphone <- as.numeric(data$iphone == 'IPhone')
```

```{r}
# estimating average treatment effect
ate <- data[, lm(screen_time_avg_final~ treatment + screen_time_avg_initial + as.factor(country) + iphone)]
ate$vcovHC_ <- vcovHC(ate)
coeftest(ate, vcov. = ate$vcovHC_)
```

This analysis regresses final average screen time (`screen_time_avg_final`) on treatment assignment (`treatment`), while controlling for initial average screen time (`screen_time_avg_initial`), country, and phone. Results suggest that the average treatment effect is -0.00033505 with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 1.272597 and that there is not a statistically significant treatment effect on final average screen time.


```{r}
# estimating the ITT

itt <- data[, lm(screen_time_avg_final ~ treatment)]
itt$vcovHC_ <- vcovHC(itt)
coeftest(itt, vcov. = itt$vcovHC_)

```

In this analysis, the final average screen time (`screen_time_avg_final`) is regressed on treatment assignment (`treatment`). Screen time is a continuous variable in units of hours and treatment assignment (`treatment`) is scored 1 if the subject was assigned to the treatment group and 0 otherwise. The ITT is 0.042928 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.730606. This result is not statistically significant.

```{r}
# using ivyreg to calculate CACE
ivyreg <- data[, ivreg(screen_time_avg_final ~ greyscale_binary, ~treatment)]
ivyreg$vcovHC_ <- vcovHC(ivyreg)
coeftest(ivyreg, vcov. = ivyreg$vcovHC_)

```

In this instrumental variables regression model, the final average screen time (`screen_time_avg_final`) is regressed on actual treatment (`greyscale_binary`) using treatment assignment(`treatment`) as an instrument. The results suggest that turning on greyscale increased screentime usage among Compliers by 4.7% with a 95% confidence interval of 1.89498. However, the results suggest that this effect is not statistically insignificant. 


## Extreme Error Bounds

### Minimum bound

```{r}
#  assume that all of the data that you did not observe was actually a very small value
min <- data[, min(screen_time_avg_final, na.rm = TRUE)]

However, the results suggest that this effect is slightly statistically insignificant.

### Mean bound

```{r}
#  assume that all of the data that you did not observe was actually the average value
mean <- data[ , mean(screen_time_avg_final, na.rm = TRUE)]

data[ , mean_screen_time := screen_time_avg_final]
data[is.na(mean_screen_time), mean_screen_time := mean]
ate_mean <- data[, lm(mean_screen_time ~ treatment + screen_time_avg_initial + as.factor(country) + iphone)]

coeftest(itt_mean, vcov. = itt_mean$vcovHC_)
```

In this analysis, the final average screen time, bounded by the mean, (`mean_screen_time`) is regressed on treatment assignment (`treatment`). Screen time is a continuous variable in units of hours and treatment assignment (`treatment`) is scored 1 if the subject was assigned to the treatment group and 0 otherwise.
